2. Attach the Handle part with the main part with the holes given and use a screw and nut to secure it together. (Use superglue if needed)
3. Slide the trigger part into place and attach a elastic string or a rubber band by connecting it through all the holes given in the main part and the trigger part.
4. Super glue the top part to the main part to secure the trigger in place.
